# Python Conditions and If statements
# Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

# Equals: a == b
# Not Equals: a != b
# Less than: a < b
# Less than or equal to: a <= b
# Greater than: a > b
# Greater than or equal to: a >= b


# control statements:
    
#     control statement are those statementss which are control the flow of Execution of a  program.

# conditional statements
        #  if
        #  else
        #  elif
        
# a = 33
# b = 200
# if b > a:
#   print("b is greater than a")

# output:b is greater than a
